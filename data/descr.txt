Please extract an MSLR-10k here as MSLR10 folder (or 30k if u're feelin' masochistic)

The dataset can be downloaded from http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/mslr/download.aspx
The resulting 
/data/MSLR10 folder must contain Fold1~Fold5 folders with text files as in the original dataset


Also extract Kaggle Higgs as /data/Higgs/training.csv if you want to play with it.
